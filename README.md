# infinite-window-exe

> A playful desktop app that spawns your GitHub profile link window in ever-increasing multiples.

## 🚀 Features

- Opens a single window showing an image that links to your GitHub.
- On clicking the "✕" close button, it spawns more windows.
- Each subsequent close doubles the count again (1 → 2 → 4 → 8 …).

## 🔧 Installation

# install dependencies
npm install
